This exciting project offers a customizable robot capable of navigating its environment while avoiding obstacles.
Here's a breakdown of its features and potential:

Hardware:

* DFROBOT DRI004 Dual Motor Driver: This heart of the robot controls the movement of its two wheels, allowing it to go forward, backward, and turn.

* SG90 Servo: This versatile servo acts as the "neck" of the robot, turning the HC-SR04 sensor to scan its surroundings for obstacles.
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor: This key component emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time they take to bounce back from objects, enabling the robot to detect and avoid obstacles in its path.
* ESP-01 WiFi Module: This module adds wireless capabilities, allowing you to control the robot remotely using various methods.
Level Converter for RX/TX Pins: This ensures safe communication between the robot and the WiFi module by adjusting voltage levels.

Control and Programming:

Multiple Control Options: The WiFi connectivity opens up numerous control possibilities:
Direct WiFi Commands: Send commands through your phone or computer to control the robot's movement directly.
Minecraft Education Edition: Program intricate robot behaviors and obstacle courses within the familiar Minecraft environment.
Custom Apps and Web Interfaces: Develop more specialized control interfaces tailored to your specific needs.
Additional Notes:

Customization Potential: The project's open-ended nature allows for various modifications and extensions:
Different sensors (cameras, LiDAR) for more sophisticated obstacle detection.
Additional modules for functionalities like line following, object manipulation, or sound detection.
Creative control interfaces using other coding platforms or even voice commands.
Overall, the #Another-One-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot presents a versatile and open-ended platform for learning about robotics, programming, and obstacle avoidance principles. Its WiFi connectivity and diverse control options unlock creative possibilities for exploration, experimentation, and fun!
